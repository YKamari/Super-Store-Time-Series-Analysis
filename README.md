**Project Overview**
**Business Problem**
Superstores face significant challenges in optimizing inventory management and maximizing sales potential within the furniture and office supplies categories.
The lack of accurate sales forecasts, inadequate insights into consumer behavior, and ineffective inventory strategies lead to understocking or overstocking issues, resulting in missed sales opportunities or increased carrying costs.

**Projective Objective**
The objective of this project is to leverage time series analysis techniques, including ARIMA, SARIMA, Facebook Prophet, and LSTM models, on sales data pertaining to furniture, office supplies and technology from the Superstore. The primary goals include:
1. Forecasting Future Sales
2. Identifying Trends, Patterns, and Seasonality
3. Actionable Insights for Inventory Management: Provide actionable insights to optimize inventory levels, ensuring adequate stock availability while minimizing surplus or shortage issues.
4. Enhancing Marketing Strategies: Understand consumer behavior and sales patterns to devise effective marketing strategies targeted at boosting furniture, office supplies and technology sales.
5. Improving Overall Business Performance: Utilize insights derived from the analysis to enhance operational efficiency, profitability, and overall business performance within these specific product categories.
